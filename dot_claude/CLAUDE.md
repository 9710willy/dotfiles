# Personal Preferences

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer functional React components with hooks
- Use pnpm for package management
- Run prettier/eslint before committing
- Don't add unnecessary comments - only when logic is non-obvious
- Prefer explicit error handling over silent failures
- Keep code simple - avoid over-engineering

# Mistakes to Avoid

<!-- Add entries here when Claude makes mistakes -->
<!-- Example: "Don't use `any` type - always define proper interfaces" -->

# My Stack

- React, TypeScript, Vite
- pnpm
- Vitest for testing
- Neovim as editor
- Ghostty terminal
